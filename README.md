# Blocks: To Full Site Editing and beyond!

Blocks and Full Site Editing are the present and the future of WordPress. Developing a block is not a huge undertaking. In this talk, I will show you the steps for creating a block, focusing on the potential and the many opportunities it can offer to the end user. 

I gave this talk at the WordCamp Italia 2022. The video of the presentation is [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=26425&v=Qad0BFPM_70&feature=youtu.be).
